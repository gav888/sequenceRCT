\title{Test between-group differences in complexity measures}
\usage{
test_complexity_measures(
  complexity_df,
  measures = c("Entropy", "Turbulence", "Volatility")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexity_df}{Data frame; output of \code{compute_complexity_measures()}, must include a \code{Group} column.}

\item{measures}{Character vector; names of complexity metrics to test (e.g., c("Entropy","Turbulence","Volatility")).}
}
\value{
Named list with one entry per measure.
  For exactly two groups, each entry contains \code{wilcox} (Wilcoxon test object)
  and \code{effect_size} (Cliff's delta object).
  For more than two groups, each entry contains \code{kruskal} (Kruskal-Wallis test object).
